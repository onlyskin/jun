Jun is a program for putting lists of words in to an order based on their
similarity to the other words in the list.

Jun is set up to work with vocab lists exported from Anki, and as such takes a
tsv file.

The idea behind Jun is that studying vocabulary lists in an order based around
how similar words are to each other may be an interesting or helpful order to
study them as while studying you have the chance to make sure you see similar
words near to each other and can be less likely to confuse them.
